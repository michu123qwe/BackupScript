# BackupScript

Script to back-up files.
Created on Ubuntu.
Currently working on Ubuntu, I haven't checked other os.
Currently types of errors aren't handled, files that can't be copied are skipped.

Usage:
1. Create folder to keep files for back-up.
2. Open terminal.
2. Enter virtual environment: "source /path/to/venv/bin/activate"
3. Run script: "/path/to/script/main.py /path/to/backup/folder /path/to/folder/to/be/backed/up"
4. List of files/folders to be moved/copied/created will be shown. If you accept it, type "y".
5. Files/directories will be copied/moved/created as listed.
